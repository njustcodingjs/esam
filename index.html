<br><b><font size=+1>Preface</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beginning student of chemistry must have a knowledge
of the theory which forms the basis for our understanding of chemistry
and he must acquire this knowledge before he has the mathematical background
required for a rigorous course of study in quantum mechanics. The present
approach is designed to meet this need by stressing the physical or observable
aspects of the theory through an extensive use of the electronic charge
density.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The manner in which the negative charge of an atom or a
molecule is arranged in three-dimensional space is determined by the electronic
charge density distribution. Thus, it determines directly the sizes and
shapes of molecules, their electrical moments and, indeed, all of their
chemical and physical properties.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the charge density describes the distribution of
negative charge in real space, it is a physically measurable quantity.
Consequently, when used as a basis for the discussion of chemistry, the
charge density allows for a direct physical picture and interpretation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, the forces exerted on a nucleus in a molecule
by the other nuclei and by the electronic charge density may be <b><i>rigorously</i></b>
calculated and interpreted in terms of classical electrostatics. Thus,
given the molecular charge distribution, the stability of a chemical bond
may be discussed in terms of the electrostatic requirement of achieving
a zero force on the nuclei in the molecule. A chemical bond is the result
of the accumulation of negative charge density in the region between any
pair of nuclei to an extent sufficient to balance the forces of repulsion.
This is true of any chemical bond, ionic or covalent, and even of the shallow
minimum in the potential curves arising from van der Waals' forces.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this treatment, the classifications of bonding,
ionic or covalent, are retained, but they are given <b><i><font face="">physical</font></i></b>
definitions in terms of the actual distribution of charge within the molecule.
In covalent bonding the valence charge density is distributed over the
whole molecule and the attractive forces responsible for binding the nuclei
are exerted by the charge density equally shared between them in the internuclear
region. In ionic bonding, the valence charge density is localized in the
region of a single nucleus and in this extreme of binding the charge density
localized on a single nucleus exerts the attractive force which binds both
nuclei.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This web page begins with a discussion of the need
for a new mechanics to describe the events at the atomic level. This is
illustrated through a discussion of experiments with electrons and light,
which are found to be inexplicable in terms of the mechanics of Newton.
The basic concepts of the quantum description of a bound electron, such
as quantization, degeneracy and its probabilistic aspect, are introduced
by <b><i>contrasting</i></b> the quantum and classical results for similar
one-dimensional systems. The atomic orbital description of the many-electron
atom and the Pauli exclusion principle are considered in some detail, and
the <i><b>experimental</b> </i>consequences of their predictions regarding
the energy, angular momentum and magnetic properties of atoms are illustrated.
The alternative interpretation of the probability distribution (for a stationary
state of an atom) as a representation of a static distribution of electronic
charge in real space is stressed, in preparation for the discussion of
the chemical bond.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chemical binding is discussed in terms of the molecular
charge distribution and the forces which it exerts on the nuclei, an approach
which may be rigorously presented using electrostatic concepts. The discussion
is enhanced through the extensive use of diagrams to illustrate both the
molecular charge distributions and the changes in the atomic charge distributions
accompanying the formation of a chemical bond.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The above topics are covered in the first seven sections
of this web page. The final section is for the reader interested in the
extension of the orbital concept to the molecular cases. An elementary
account of the use of symmetry in predicting the electronic structure of
molecules is given in this section.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The physical picture of chemical binding afforded
by the study of molecular charge distributions has been forced to await
the availability of molecular wave functions of considerable quality. The
author, together with the reader who finds the approach presented in this
volume helpful in his understanding of chemistry, is indebted to the people
who overcame the formidable mathematical obstacles encountered in obtaining
these wave functions.
