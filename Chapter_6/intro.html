<br><b><font size=+1>The Chemical Bond</font></b>
<p>With our knowledge of the electronic structure of atoms we are now in
a position to understand the existence of molecules. Clearly, the force
which binds the atoms together to form a molecule will, as in the atomic
case, be the electrostatic force of attraction between the nuclei and electrons.
In a molecule, however, we encounter a force of repulsion between the nuclei
in addition to that between the electrons. To account for the existence
of molecules we must account for the predominance of the attractive interactions.
We shall give general arguments to show that this is so, first in terms
of the energy of a molecule, relative to the energies of the constituent
atoms, and secondly, in terms of the forces acting on the nuclei in a molecule.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to determine what attractive and repulsive interactions
are possible in a molecule, consider an instantaneous configuration of
the nuclei and electrons in a hydrogen molecule <font color="#000000"><a href="intro.html#Fig_6-1">(Fig.
6-1)</a></font>. When the two atoms are initially far apart (the distance
<i>R</i>
is very large) the only potential interactions are the attraction of nucleus
A for electron number (1) and the attraction of nucleus B for electron
number (2). When <i>R</i> is comparable to the diameter of an atom (A and
B are close enough to form a molecule) then new interactions appear. Nucleus
A will now attract electron (2) as well as (1) and similarly nucleus B
will attract electron (1) as well as (2). These interactions are indicated
by the four solid lines in <font color="#000000"><a href="intro.html#Fig_6-1">Fig.
6-1</a></font> connecting pairs of particles which attract one another.
<p><a name="Fig_6-1"></a>

<br><font size=-1><b>Fig. 6-1.</b>&nbsp; One possible set of the instantaneous
relative positions of the electrons and nuclei in an H., molecule. The
dashed lines represent the repulsive interactions between like charges
and the solid lines indicate the attractive interactions between opposite
charges.</font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of attractive interactions
has been doubled from what it was when the atoms were far apart. However,
the reduction in<i> R</i> introduces two repulsive interactions as well,
indicated by the dashed lines joining charges of like sign in <a href="intro.html#Fig_6-1">Fig.
6-1</a>. The two electrons now repel one another as do the two nuclei.
If the two atoms are to remain together to form a molecule, the attractive
interactions must exceed the repulsive ones. It is clear from <a href="intro.html#Fig_6-1">Fig.
6-1</a> that the new attractive interactions, nucleus A attracting electron
(2) and nucleus B attracting electron (1), will be large only if there
is a high probability of both electrons being found in the region between
the nuclei. When in this region, both electrons are strongly attracted
by both nuclei, rather than by just one nucleus as is the case when the
atoms are far apart.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the average potential energy is calculated by
quantum mechanics, the attractive interactions are found to predominate
over the repulsive ones because quantum mechanics does indeed predict a
high probability for each electron being in the region between the nuclei.
This general consideration of the energy demonstrates that electron density
must be concentrated between the nuclei if a stable molecule is to be formed,
for only in this way can the attractive interaction be maximized. We can
be much more specific in our analysis of this problem if we discuss a molecule
from the point of view of the forces acting on the nuclei. However, we
must first state some general conclusions of quantum mechanics regarding
molecular systems.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the atomic case we could fix the position of the nucleus
in space and consider only the motion of the electrons relative to the
nucleus. In molecules, the nuclei may also change positions relative to
one another. This complication can, however, be removed. The nuclei are
very massive compared to the electrons and their average velocities are
consequently much smaller than those possessed by the electrons. In a classical
picture of the molecule we would see a slow, lumbering motion of the nuclei
accompanied by a very rapid motion of the electrons. The physical implication
of this large disparity in the two sets of velocities is that the electrons
can immediately adjust to any change in the position of the nuclei. The
positions of&nbsp; the nuclei determine the potential field in which the
electrons move. However, as the nuclei change their positions and hence
the potential field, the electrons can immediately adjust to the new positions.
<b><i>Thus
the motion of&nbsp; the electrons is determined by where the nuclei are
but not by how fast the nuclei are moving</i></b>. We may, because of this
fact, discuss the motions of the electrons and of the nuclei separately.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For a given distance between the nuclei we obtain the energy,
the wave function and the electron density distribution of the electrons,
the nuclei being held in fixed positions. Then the distance between the
nuclei is changed to a new value, and the calculation of the energy, wave
function and electron density distribution of the electrons is performed
again. This process, repeated for every possible internuclear distance,
allows us to determine how the energy of the electrons changes as the distance
between the nuclei is changed. More important for our present discussion,
we may concern ourselves only with the motion of the electrons and hold
the nuclei stationary at some particular value for the internuclear distance<i>
R</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The energy of the electrons in a molecule is quantized,
as it is in atoms. When the nuclei are held stationary at some fixed value
of <i>R</i>, there are a number of allowed energy levels for the electrons.
There are, however, no simple expressions for the energy levels of a molecule
in terms of a set of quantum numbers such as we found for the hydrogen
atom. In any event we shall be concerned here only with the first or lowest
of the energy levels for a molecule. As in the case of atoms, there is
a wave function which governs the motion of all the electrons for each
of the allowed energy levels. Each wave function again determines the manner
in which the electronic charge is distributed in three-dimensional space.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The electron density distribution for a molecule is best
illustrated by means of a contour map, of the kind introduced earlier in
the discussion of the hydrogen atom. <font color="#000000"><a href="intro.html#Fig_6-2">Figure
6-2</a></font> shows a contour map of the charge distribution for the lowest,
or most stable state of the hydrogen molecule. Imagine a hydrogen molecule
to be cut in half by a plane which contains the nuclei.The amount of electronic
charge at every point in space is determined, and all points having the
same value for the electron density in the plane are joined by a line,
a contour line. Also shown is a profile of the contour map along the internuclear
axis. A profile illustrates the variation in the charge density along a
single axis.

<p><font size=-1><b>Fig. 6-2.</b>&nbsp; A contour map of the electron density
distribution (or the molecular charge distribution) for H</font><sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub><font size=-1>
in a plane containing the nuclei. Also shown is a profile of the density
distribution along the internuclear axis. The internuclear separation is
1.4 au. The values of the contours increase in magnitude from the outermost
one inwards towards the nuclei. The values of the contours in this and
all succeeding diagrams are given in au; 1 au = <i>e</i>/<i>a</i><sub>o</sub><sup>3</sup>
= 6.749 <i>e</i>/&Aring;<sup>3</sup>.</font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The electron density contours of highest value are in the
region of each nucleus. Thus the negative charge is concentrated in the
region of the nuclei in a molecule as well as in an atom. The next highest
concentration of negative charge is found in the region between the nuclei.
It is the negative charge in this region which is strongly attracted by
both nuclei and which results in the attractive interactions exceeding
the repulsive ones in the formation of the molecule from the atoms. Most
of the density contours envelope both nuclei. The density distributions
of the two atoms have been merged together in the formation of the molecule.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same contour map would be obtained for any plane through
the nuclei. Therefore, in three-dimensional space the hydrogen molecule
would appear to be an ellipsoidal distribution of negative charge. Most
of the electronic charge is concentrated along the internuclear axis and
becomes progressively more diffuse at large distances from the centre of
the molecule. Recall that the addition of all the charge in every small
volume element of space equals the total number of electrons which in the
case of the hydrogen molecule is two. The volume of space enclosed by the
outer contour in <font color="#000000"><a href="intro.html#Fig_6-2">Fig. 6-2</a></font>
contains over 99% of the total electronic charge of the hydrogen molecule.
