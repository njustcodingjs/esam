<br><b><font size=+1>Molecular geometry</font></b>
<p>The theory of valency which we have been developing is known as <b><i>valence
bond theory</i></b>. One further feature of this theory is that it may
be used to predict (or in some cases, rationalize) the observed geometries
of molecules By the geometry of a molecule we mean the relative arrangement
of the nuclei in three-dimensional space. For example, assuming the two
O—H bonds in the water molecule to be similar and hence of the same length,
the angle formed by the two O—H bonds (the HOH angle could conceivably
posess any angle from 180&deg; to some relatively small value. All we demand
of our simple theory is that it correctly predict whether the water molecule
is linear (bond angle = 180&deg;) or bent (bond angle less than 180&deg;)&nbsp;
Or as another example, it should predict whether the ammonia molecule is
planar (a) or pyramidal (b).
<br>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp; The observed geometry of a molecule is that which makes the energy
of the system a minimum. Thus those geometries will be favoured which (i)
concentrate the largest amount of charge density in the binding region
and thus give the strongest individual bonds, and (ii) keep the nuclei
as far apart as possible (consistent with (i)), and hence reduce the nuclear
replusions. Consider again the two possibilities for the water molecule
It is clear that the linear form (a) will have a smaller energy of nuclear
repulsion from the hydrogens than will the bent form (b).
<center><img src="h2o.jpg" height=156 width=473></center>
If the amount of electron density which could be concentrated in the regions
between the nuclei in each O—H bond (i.e., the strength of each O—H bond)
was independent of the bond angle, then clearly the linear form of the
water molecule would be the most stable. This would be the situation if
all the atomic orbitals which describe the motions of the electrons were
rigidly spherical and centred on the nuclei. But this is not the case.
As was stressed earlier in our discussion of atomic orbitals, the motion
of electrons possessing angular momentum because they occupy orbitals with
<i><font color="#000000">l
</font></i><font face="Symbol">&sup1;</font><font color="#000000">
0</font> is concentrated along certain axes or planes in space. In particular
the three <i>p</i> orbitals are a maximum along the three perpendicular
axes in space. The valence bond theory of the water molecule describes
the two O—H bonds as resulting from the overlap of the H 1<i>s</i> orbitals
with the two half-filled 2<i>p</i> orbitals of the oxygen atom. Since the
two 2<i>p</i> orbitals are at right angles to one another, valence bond
theory predicts a bent geometry for the water molecule with a bond angle
of 90&deg;.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The overlap of the orbitals is shown schematically in <a href="section_4.html#Fig_6-16">Fig.
6-16</a>.
<p><a name="Fig_6-16"></a>
<center><img src="fig6-16.jpg" height=300 width=357>
<br><font size=-1><b>Fig. 6-16.</b> A pictorial representation of the overlap
of 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals on the oxygen
with the 1<i>s</i> orbitals of two H atoms.</font></center>
<p>The actual bond angle in the water molecule is 104.5&deg;. The opening
of the angle to a value greater than the predicted one of 90&deg; can be
accounted for in terms of a lessening of the repulsion between the hydrogen
nuclei. The <b><i>assumption</i></b> we have made is that the maximum amount
of electron density will be transferred to the binding region and hence
yield the strongest possible bond when the hydrogen and oxygen nuclei lie
on the axis which is defined by the direction of the 2<i>p</i> orbital.
For a given internuclear separation, this will result in the maximum overlap
of the orbitals. Because an orbital with <font color="#000000"><i>l </i><font face="Symbol">&sup1;</font>
0</font> restricts the motion of the electron to certain preferred directions
in space, bond angles and molecular geometry will be determined, <b><i>to
a first rough approximation</i></b>, by the inter-orbital angles.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the valence bond description of ammonia, each N—H bond
results from the overlap of an H 1<i>s</i> orbital with a 2<i>p</i> orbital
on N. All three 2<i>p </i>orbitals on N have a vacancy and thus three bonds
should be formed and each HNH angle should be 90&deg;, i.e., ammonia should
be a pyramidal and not a planar molecule. The NH<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub>
molecule is indeed pyramidal and the observed HNH angle is 107.3&deg;.
The actual bond angle is again larger than that predicted by the theory.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be argued that since the N atom possesses a half-filled
2<i>p </i>shell (its electronic configuration is 1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>2<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>2<i>p</i><sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>),
its density distribution is spherical and hence the N atom should not exhibit
any directional preferences in its bonding. This argument is incorrect
for the following reason. The density distribution is obtained by squaring
the wave function. The wave function which properly describes the system
must be obtained first, then squared to obtain the density. The wave function
which describes the ammonia molecule consists of products of hydrogen 1<i>s</i>
orbital functions with the nitrogen 2<i>p</i> orbital functions. (A product
of orbitals is the mathematical statement of the phrase "overlap of orbitals"
in valence bond theory.) The density distribution obtained by squaring
the product of two orbitals is <b><i>not</i></b> the same as that obtained
from the sum of the squares of the individual orbitals. Thus in the valence
bond theory of molecular electronic structure the directional properties
of the valence orbitals play an important role. By assuming that the most
stable bond results when the two nuclei joined by the bond lie along the
axis defined by the orbitals and considering the bonds to a first approximation
to be independent of one another, we can predict the geometries of molecules.
<p><b>Hybridization</b>
<p>The BeH<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub> molecule is linear and the
two Be—H bonds are equivalent. The valence bond description of BeH<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>&nbsp;
accounted for the two-fold valency of&nbsp; Be (which has the ground state
configuration 1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>2<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>)
by assuming the bonding to occur with a promoted configuration of Be:
<center>Be*&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#CC0000"> </font><font color="#000000">1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>2<i>s</i>(<font face="Symbol">&shy;</font>)2<i>p</i>(<font face="Symbol">&shy;</font>)</font></center>
<p>At first sight this suggests that the two Be—H bonds should be dissimilar
and not necessarily 180&deg; apart because one bond results from the overlap
with a 2<i>s</i> orbital and the other with a 2<i>p</i> orbital on Be.
We can, however, account for the equivalence of the two Be—H bonds and
for the linearity of the molecule within the framework of the theory. There
is no <b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>priori</i></b> reason for assuming that the
one bond will result from the overlap with a 2<i>s</i> orbital and the
other from the overlap with a 2<i>p</i> orbital. In the most general treatment
of the problem, each bond to a hydrogen could involve both the 2<i>s</i>
and the 2<i>p</i> orbitals. That is, we can "mix" or<b><i> hybridize</i></b>
the valence orbitals on the Be atom. In fact, by taking each valence orbital
on Be to be an equal part of 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i>, we can obtain two
equivalent hybrid orbitals which are directed 180&deg; apart. The two hybrid
orbitals will form two equivalent bonds with the H 1<i>s </i>orbitals whose
total bond strength will be larger than that obtained by forming one bond
with a 2<i>p</i> and the other with a 2<i>s </i>orbital on Be.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction of the hybrid orbitals is accomplished
by taking the sum and the difference of the 2<i>s</i> orbital and one of
the 2<i>p </i>orbitals, say the 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> orbital, both orbitals
being centred on the Be nucleus. This is illustrated in <a href="section_4.html#Fig_6-17">Fig.
6-17</a>.

<br><font size=-1><b>Fig. 6-17.</b> The construction of <i>sp</i> hybrid
orbitals from a 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i> atomic orbital on Be.</font></center>
<p>Since the 2<i>p </i>orbital has a node at the nucleus the 2<i>p</i>
orbital wave function has opposite signs on each side of the nodal plane
indicated in the figure. Both orbitals are positive on one side and the
orbital functions add at each point in space. On the other side of the
nodal plane, the orbitals&nbsp; are of opposite sign and their sum yields
the difference between the two functions at every point in space. The addition
of a 2<i>s </i>and 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> orbital concentrates the wave
function and hence the charge density on the positive side of the <i>x</i>-axis.
Obviously the combination (2<i>s</i> - 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i>) will be similar
in appearance but concentrated on the negative side of the <i>x</i>-axis.
These combinations of the 2<i>s</i> and 2<i>p</i> orbitals yield <b><i>two</i></b>
hybrid orbitals which are equivalent and oppositely directed. Since each
of the hybrid orbitals is constructed from equal amounts of the 2<i>s</i>&nbsp;
and 2<i>p</i> orbitals they are termed&nbsp; "<i>sp</i> hybrid" orbitals.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The linear nature of BeH<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>
can be explained if it is assumed (as is true)&nbsp; that the best overlap
with both H 1<i>s</i> orbitals will result when the valence orbitals on
the Be are <i>sp</i> hybrids <a href="section_4.html#Fig_6-18">(Fig. 6-18)</a>.

<p>The three B—H bonds in BH<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub> are equivalent
and the molecule is planar and symmetrical:

<p>The promoted configuration of boron with three unpaired electrons is
<center>B*&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000000">1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>2<i>s</i>(<font face="Symbol">&shy;</font>)2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i>(<font face="Symbol">&shy;</font>)2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i>(<font face="Symbol">&shy;</font>)</font></center>
<p>In this case we must construct three equivalent hybrid orbitals from
the three atomic orbitals 2<i>s</i>, 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i>, and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i>,
on boron. The 2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals
define a plane in space and the three hybrid orbitals constructed from
them will be projected in this same plane. Since the hybrid orbitals are
to be equivalent, each must contain one part 2<i>s</i> and two parts 2<i>p</i>.
They will be called "<i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>" hybrid
orbitals. The three orbital combinations which have the above properties
are indeed directed at 120&deg; to one another. The planar, symmetrical
geometry of BH<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub> can be accounted for in
terms of <i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> hybridization of the
orbitals on boron.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The four C—H bonds in CH<sub><font size=-2>4</font></sub>
are equivalent and the molecule possesses a tetrahedral geometry:
<center><img src="ch4.jpg" height=282 width=221></center>
The promoted configuration of carbon with four unpaired spins is

<p>Four equivalent hybrid orbitals can be constructed from the 2<i>s </i>and
the three 2<i>p</i> orbitals on carbon. Each orbital will contain one part&nbsp;
2<i>s</i> and three parts 2<i>p</i>, and the hybrids are termed <i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>
hybrids. Only one such set of orbitals is possible and the angle between
the orbitals is&nbsp; <font color="#000000">109&deg;28<b><i>'</i></b>,
</font>the
tetrahedral angle. The tetrahedral geometry of CH<sub><font size=-2>4</font></sub>
is described as resulting from the <i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>3 </font></sup>hybridization
of the valence orbitals on the carbon atom.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The three hybridization schemes which have been presented
are sufficient to account for the geometries of all the compounds formed
from elements of the first two rows of the periodic table (those with <i>n</i>=
1 or<i> n</i> = 2 valence orbitals). Consider, for example, the unsaturated
hydrocarbons. The ethylene molecule, C<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>H<sub><font size=-2>4</font></sub>,
possesses the planar geometry indicated here,
<center><img src="c2h4.jpg" height=192 width=303></center>
<p>where the bond angles around each carbon nucleus are approximately 120&deg;.
Three bonds in a plane with 120&deg; bond angles suggests <i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>
hybridization for the carbon atoms. Two of the <i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>
hybrids from each carbon may overlap with H 1<i>s</i> orbitals forming
the four C—H bonds. The remaining <i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>2 </font></sup>hybrids
on each carbon may overlap with one another to form a bond
<br>between the carbons:
<center><img src="c2h4a.jpg" height=223 width=420></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> hybrids
are denoted by arrows in the above diagram to indicate their directional
dependence. If these bonds are formed in the <i>x-y</i> plane, using the
2<i>p<sub>x</sub></i> and 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals of the carbon
atoms, a singly-occupied 2<i>p<sub>z </sub></i>orbital will remain on each
carbon. They will be directed in a plane perpendicular to the plane of
the molecule:
<center>
<p><img src="c2h4b.jpg" height=159 width=321></center>
<p>The overlap of the two 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals above and below
the plane of the molecule will result in a second electron pair bond between
the carbon atoms. The bonds formed in the plane of the molecule are called<font face="Symbol">
s</font> (sigma) bonds, while those perpendicular to the plane are called
<font face="Symbol">p</font>
bonds. Since the overlap of the orbitals to form a <font face="Symbol">p</font>
bond is not as great as the overlap obtained from <font face="Symbol">s</font>
bonds (which are directed along the bond axis), <font face="Symbol">p</font>
bonds in general are weaker than <font face="Symbol">s</font> bonds. A
Lewis structure for the C<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>H<sub><font size=-2>4</font></sub>
molecule is expressed as
<center>
<p><img src="c2h4c.jpg" height=139 width=269></center>
<p>indicating that there is a double bond between the carbon atoms, i.e.,
the density from two pairs of electrons binds the carbon atoms.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The energy required to break the carbon-carbon double bond
in ethylene is indeed greater than that required to break the carbon-carbon
single bond in the ethane molecule, H<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub>C—CH<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub>.
Furthermore, the chemical behaviour of ethylene is readily accounted for
in terms of a model which places a large concentration of negative charge
density in the region between the carbon atoms. The physical evidence thus
verifies the valence bond description of the bonding between the carbons
in ethylene.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our final example concerns another important possible hybridization
for the carbon atom. The acetylene molecule, C<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>H<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>,
is a linear symmetric molecule: H—C—C—H. The linear structure suggests
we try <i>sp</i> hybridization for each carbon, one hybrid overlapping
with a hydrogen and the other with a similar hybrid from the second carbon
atom. This will produce a linear&nbsp; <font face="Symbol">s </font>bond
framework for the molecule:
<center>
<p><img src="c2h2.jpg" height=81 width=415></center>
<p>The <i>sp</i> hybrids are denoted by arrows in the above diagram. If
the <i>sp </i>hybrids are assumed to be directed along the <i>x</i>-axis,
then the remaining singly-occupied&nbsp; 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> and&nbsp;
2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals on each carbon may form <font face="Symbol">p</font>
bonds. The 2<i>p<sub>y</sub></i> orbitals on each carbon may overlap to
form a <font face="Symbol">p</font> bond whose density is concentrated
in the <i>x-y</i> plane, with a node in the <i>x-z</i> plane. Similarly
the 2<i>p<sub>z</sub></i> orbitals may form a second <font face="Symbol">p</font>
bond concentrated in the <i>x-z</i> plane, with a node in the <i>x-y</i>
plane. Acetylene will possess a triple bond, one involving three pairs
of electrons, between the carbon atoms. The Lewis structure is drawn as
<center>
<p><img src="c2h2b.jpg" height=40 width=265></center>
<p>where it is understood that one of the C—C bonds is a <font face="Symbol">s</font>
bond while the other two are of the <font face="Symbol">p</font>-type.
The chemistry and properties of acetylene are consistent with a model which
places a large amount of charge density in the region of the C—C bond.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hybridization schemes involving <i>d</i> orbitals are also
possible. They are important for elements in the third and succeeding rows
of the periodic table. Although the elements of the third row do not possess
occupied 3<i>d </i>orbitals in their ground electronic configurations,
the 3<i>d</i> orbitals of phosphorus, sulphur and chlorine are low enough
in energy that promoted configurations involving the 3<i>d</i> orbitals
may be reasonably postulated to account for the binding in compounds of
these elements. One consequence of the "availability" of the 3<i>d</i>
orbitals is that there are many exceptions to the octet rule in compounds
of the third row elements. For example, in PCl<sub><font size=-2>5 </font></sub>there
are ten valence electrons involved in the bonding of the five chlorines
to the phosphorus. A hybridization scheme based on the promotion of one
3<i>s</i> electron of phosphorus to a 3<i>d</i> orbital to yield five "<i>dsp</i><sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>"
hybrid orbitals correctly predicts the trigonal bypyramidal structure of
PCl<sub><font size=-2>5</font></sub>:
<center><img src="pcl5.jpg" height=281 width=362></center>
<p>&nbsp; As a final example consider the molecule SF<sub><font size=-2>6</font></sub>
in which all six S—F bonds are equivalent and the geometry is that of a
regular octahedron (one F atom centred in each face of a regular cube):
<center>
<p><img src="sf6.jpg" height=272 width=276></center>
<p>This geometry and number of bonds can be accounted for by assuming the
promotion of one 3<i>s</i> and one 3<i>p</i> electron to two of the 3<i>d</i>
orbitals on the sulphur atom. This hybridization yields six equivalent
"<i>d</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup><i>sp</i><sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>"
hybrid bonds which are indeed directed as indicated in the structure for
SF<sub><font size=-2>6</font></sub>.
