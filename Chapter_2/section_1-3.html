<br><b><font size=+1>Position</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of a trajectory is fundamental to classical
mechanics. Given a particular mass with a given initial velocity and a
knowledge of the forces acting on it, we may use classical mechanics to
predict the exact position and velocity of the particle at any future time.
Thus we speak of the trajectory of the particle and we may calculate it
to any desired degree of accuracy. It is also possible, within the framework
of classical mechanics, to measure the position and velocity of a particle
at any given instant of time. Thus classical mechanics correctly predicts
what one can experimentally measure for massive particles.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have previously mentioned the difficulties which
are encountered when we attempt to determine the position of an electron.
The results of the Compton effect indicate that part of the energy of the
photon used in making the observation is transferred to the electron, and
we invariably disturb the electron when we attempt to measure its position.
Thus it is not surprising to find that quantum mechanics does not predict
the position of an electron exactly. Rather, it provides only a <b><i>probability</i></b>
as to where the electron will be found. When we consider the experiments
which attempt to define the position of the electron, we shall find that
this is the maximum information that can indeed be obtained even experimentally.
The new mechanics again predicts only what can indeed be measured experimentally.&nbsp;
We shall illustrate the probability aspect in terms of the system of an
electron confined to motion along a line of length <i>L</i>. Quantum mechanical
probabilities are expressed in terms of a distribution function which in
this particular case we shall label <i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub>(x)</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the line of length <i>L</i> to be divided
into a large number of very small segments, each of length <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.
Then the probability that the electron is in one particular small segment
<font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
of the line is given by the product of <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
and the value of the probability distribution function <i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub>(x)</i>
for that interval. For example, the probability distribution function for
the electron when it is in the lowest energy level, <i>n</i> = 1, is given
by <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i> <a href="section_1-3.html#Fig_2-4.">(Fig.

equals the probability that the electron is in the particular segment of

The percentage shown in each rectangle</font> <font size=-1>is the percentage
probability that the electron is in a particular segment <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.
The total probability that the electron is somewhere on the line is given
by the total area under</font> <font size=-1>the <i>P</i></font><i><sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub><font size=-1>(x)</font></i><font size=-1>
curve, that is, by the sum of each small element of area <i>P</i></font><i><sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub><font size=-1>(x)</font></i><font size=-1><font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>

<p>The probability that the electron will be in the particular small interval

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The curve <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i>
may be determined in the following manner. We design an experiment able
to determine whether or not the electron is in one particular segment <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
of the line when it is known to be in the quantum level <i>n</i> = 1. (One
way in which this might be done is described below.) We perform the experiment
a large number of times, say one hundred, for each segment and record the
ratio of the number of times the electron is found in a particular segment
to the total number of observations made for that segment. For example,
an electron is found to be in the segment marked <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
(of length 0.1<i> L</i>) in the figure for <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i>
in 18 out of 100 observations, or 18% of the time. In the other 82 observations
the electron was in one of the other segments. Thus the average value of
<i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i>
for this segment, called <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x</i>'<i>)</i>
must be 1.8/<i>L</i> since <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x</i>'<i>)</i><font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>&nbsp;
= (1.8/<i>L</i>) (0.1 <i>L</i>) = 0.18 or 18%. A similar set of experiments
is made for each of the segments <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i> and
in each case a rectangle is constructed with <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
as base and with a height equal to <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i>
such that the product <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i><font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
equals the fractional number of times the electron is found in the segment
<font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.
The limiting case in which the total length <i>L</i> is divided into a
very large number of very small segments (<font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x
</i><font face="Symbol">&reg;</font>
d<i>x</i>) would result in the smooth curve shown in the figure for <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a different probability distribution for
each value of <i>E<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub></i>, or each quantum
level, as shown, for example, by the probability distributions for the
energy levels with <i>n</i> = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 <font color="#3366FF"><a href="section_1-3.html#Fig_2-4.">(Fig.
2-4)</a></font>.&nbsp; The probability of finding the electron at the positions
where the curve touches the<i> x</i>-axis is zero. Such a zero is termed
a <b><i>node</i></b>. The number of nodes is always <i>n</i>-1 if we do
not count the nodes at the ends of each <i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub>(x)</i>
curve.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us first contrast these results, particularly
that for <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i>, with the corresponding
classical case. Since a classical analysis allows us to determine the position
of a particle uniquely at any instant, either theoretically or experimentally,
the idea of a probability distribution is foreign to a classical mechanical
analysis. However, we still can determine the classical probability distribution
for the particle confined to motion on a line. Since there are no forces
acting on the particle as it traverses the line, it will be equally likely
to be found at any point on the line <a href="section_1-3.html#Fig_2-5.">(Fig 2-5)</a>.
This probability will be the same regardless of the energy. There is again
a striking difference between the classical and the quantum mechanics results.
For the first quantum level, the graph of <i>P<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>(x)</i>
indicates the electron will most likely be found at the midpoint of the
line. Furthermore, the form of <i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub>(x)</i>
changes with every change in energy. <b><i>Every allowed value of the of
the energy has associated with it a distinct probability distribution for
the electron</i></b>.&nbsp; Theses are the predictions of quantum mechanics
regarding the position of a bound electron. Now let us investigate the
experimental aspect of the problem to gain some physical reason for these
predictions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us design an experiment in which we attempt to pinpoint
the position of an electron within a segment <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.
The experiment is a hypothetical one in that we imagine that we are to
observe the electron through a microscope by reflecting or scattering light
from it. Imagine the lens of a microscope being placed above the line<i>
L</i> with the light entering from the side <a href="section_1-3.html#Fig_2-6.">(Fig. 2-6
(a))</a>. The electron, when illuminated with light, will act as a small
source of light and will produce at <i>A</i> an image in the form of a
bright disc surrounded by a group of rings of decreasing intensity. Because
of this effect, which is entirely analogous to the diffraction effect observed
for a pinhole source of light, the centre of the image will appear bright
even if the electron is not precisely located at the point marked <i>x</i>.
It could equally well have been at any value of<i> x</i> between the points<i>
x</i>' and<i> x</i>" and produced an image visible to the eye at <i>A</i>
if the difference in the path lengths B<i>x</i>' and C<i>x</i>' (or B<i>x</i>"
and C<i>x</i>") is less than one half of a wavelength. In other words the
resolving power of a microscope is not unlimited but is instead determined
by the wavelength of the light used in making the observation. The use
of the microscope imposes an inherent uncertainty in our observation of
the position of the electron. With the condition that the difference in
the path lengths to the outside rim of the lens must be no greater than
one half a wavelength and with the use of some geometry, the magnitude
of the uncertainty in the position of the electron, <i>x</i>'' - <i>x</i>'
= <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>, is found to be given approximately
by:

he position of an electron.</font></center>
<p>&nbsp; Remembering the Compton effect and bearing in mind that we wish
to disturb the electron as little as possible during the observation, we
shall inquire as to the results obtained when a single photon is scattered
from the electron. A single photon will not yield the complete diffraction
pattern at <i>A</i>, but will instead produce a single flash of light.
A diffraction pattern is the result of many photons passing through the
microscope and represents the probability distribution for the emergent
photons when they have been scattered by an electron lying between<i> x</i>'
and<i> x</i>''. A single photon, when scattered from an electron within
the length <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>, is however still diffracted
and will produce a flash of light somewhere in one of the areas defined
by the probability distribution produced by many photons passing through
the system.
<p>&nbsp; Thus even when we use but a single photon in our apparatus the
uncertainty <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i> in our experimentally
determined position of the electron will still be given by equation <b><font color="#3333FF">(3)</font></b>.
Obviously, if we want to locate an electron which is confined to move on
a line to within a length that is small compared to the length of the line,
we must use light which has a wavelength much less than<i> L</i>. This
is exactly what equation <b><font color="#3333FF">(3)</font></b> states:
the shorter the wavelength of the light which is used to observe the electron,
the smaller will be the uncertainty <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>.
That being the case, why not do the experiment with light of very short
wavelength compared to the length <i>L</i>, say <font face="Symbol">l</font>
= (1/100)<i>L</i>? Then we can hope to find the electron on one small segment
of the line, each segment being approximately (1/100)<i>L</i> in length.
Let us calculate the frequency and energy of a photon which has the required
wavelength of <font face="Symbol">l</font> = (1/100)<i>L</i>. As before,
we set<i> L</i> equal to a typical atomic dimension of 1<font face="Gill Sans">

We are immediately in difficulty, because the energy of the electron in
the first quantum level is easily found to be:

The energy of the photon is approximately 1<font face="Gill Sans"> x</font>
10<sup>4</sup> times greater than the energy of the electron! We know from
the Compton effect that the collision of a photon with an electron imparts
energy to the electron. Thus the electron after the collision will certainly
not be in the state <i>n</i> = 1. It will be excited to one<font face="LotusWP Type">C</font>we
don't know which<font face="LotusWP Type">C</font>of the excited levels
with <i>n</i> = 2 (<i>E</i> = 4<i>K</i>) or <i>n</i> = 3 (<i>E </i>= 9<i>K</i>),
etc. The result is clear. If we demand an intimate knowledge of what the
position of the electron is in a given state, we can obtain this information
only at the expense of imparting to the electron an unknown amount of energy
which destroys the system, i.e., the electron is no longer in the <i>n</i>
= 1 level but in one of the other excited levels. If this experiment was
repeated a large number of times and a record kept of the number of times
an electron was located in each segment of the line (roughly (1/100)<i>L</i>),
a probability plot similar to <font color="#FF0000"><a href="section_1-3.html#Fig_2-4.">Fig.
2-4</a></font> would be obtained.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can ask another kind of question regarding the
position of the electron: "How much information can be obtained about the
position of the electron in a given quantum level without at the same time
destroying that level?" The electron cannot accept energy in an amount
less than that necessary to excite it to the next quantum level, <i>n</i>
= 2. The difference in energy between <i>E<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub></i>,
and <i>E<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub></i>, is 3<i>K</i>. Thus if we
are to leave the electron in a state of known energy and momentum we must
use light whose photons possess an energy less than 3<i>K</i>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us calculate the wavelength of the light with<font face="Symbol">
e</font> = 2<i>K</i> and compare this value with the length<i> L</i>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wavelength is greater than the length of the line
<i>L</i>.
From equation <b><font color="#3333FF">(3)</font></b> it is clear that
the uncertainty in the position of the particle will be of the order of
magnitude of, or greater than, <i>L</i> itself. The electron will appear
to be blurred over the complete length of the line in a single experiment!
Thus there are two interpretations which can be given to the probability
distributions, depending on the experiment which is performed. The first
is that of a true probability of finding the electron in a given small
segment of the line using light of very short <font face="Symbol">l</font>
relative to <i>L</i>. This experiment excites the electron, changes the
system and leaves the electron with an unknown amount of energy and momentum.
We have destroyed the object of our investigation. We now know where it
was in a given experiment but not where it will be, in terms of energy
or position.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, we could use light with a <font face="Symbol">l</font>
approximately equal to <i>L</i>. This does not excite the electron and
leaves it in a known energy level. However, now the knowledge of the position
is very uncertain. The photons are scattered from the system and give us
directly the smeared distribution <i>P<sub><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>1</font></font></sub></i>
pictured in <font color="#CC0000"><a href="section_1-3.html#Fig_2-4.">Fig. 2-4</a></font>.
In a real sense we must accept the fact that when the electron remains
in a given state it is "smeared out" and "looks like" the pictures given
for <i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub></i>. Thus we can interpret the
<i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub></i>'s
as instantaneous pictures of the electron when it is bound in a known state,
and forgot their probability aspect. This "smeared out" distribution is
given a special name; it is called the <b><i>electron density distribution</i></b>.
There will be a certain fraction of the total electronic charge at each
point on the line, and when we consider a system in three dimensions, there
will be a certain fraction of the total electronic charge in every small
volume of space. Hence it is given the name electron density, the amount
of charge per unit volume of space. The <i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub></i>'s
represent a charge density distribution which is considered static as long
as the electron remains in the <i>n</i>th quantum level. Thus the <i>P<sub><font size=-2>n</font></sub></i>
functions tell us either (a) the <b><i>fraction of time</i></b> the electron
is at each point on the line for observations employing light of short
wavelength, or (b) they tell us the <b><i>fraction of the total charge</i></b>
found at each point on the line (the whole of the charge being spread out)
when the observations are made with light of relatively long wavelength.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The electron density distributions of atoms, molecules
or ions in a crystal can be determined experimentally by X-ray scattering
experiments since X-rays can be generated with wavelengths of the same
order of magnitude as atomic diameters (1 <font face="Symbol">&acute;</font>
10<sup>-8</sup> cm). In X-ray scattering the intensity of the scattered
beam and the angle through which it is scattered are measured. The distribution
of negative charge within the crystal scatters the X-rays and determines
the intensity and angle of scattering. Thus these experimental quantities
can be used to calculate the form of the electron density distribution.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a definite quantum mechanical relationship
governing the magnitudes of the uncertainties encountered in measurements
on the atomic level. We can illustrate this relationship for the one-dimensional
system. Let us consider the minimum uncertainty in our observations of
the position and the momentum of the electron moving on a line obtained
in an experiment which leaves the particle bound in a given quantum level,
say <i>n</i> = 1. This will require the use of light with <font face="Symbol">l</font>
~ <i>L</i>. We have seen that the use of light of this wavelength limits
us to stating that the electron is somewhere on the line of length <i>L</i>.
We can say no more than this with certainty unless we use light of much
shorter <font face="Symbol">l</font> , and then we will change the quantum
number of the electron. The uncertainty in the value of the position coordinate,
which we shall call <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>, is just <i>L</i>,
the length of the line:

The minimum uncertainty in our knowledge of the momentum is the difference
between these two possibilities, or for <i>n</i> = 1:

This result is a <i>particular example</i> of a general relationship governing
the product of the uncertainties in the momentum and position known as
<i><b>Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</b></i>. In the general case, the equality
sign in the above equation is replaced by the symbol "<font face="Symbol">&sup3;</font>" which denotes that
the product in the uncertainties <font face="Symbol">D</font>p<font face="Symbol">D</font>x equals or exceeds the value
of Planck's contant h, that is, the general statement is given by
<font face="Symbol">D</font>p<font face="Symbol">D</font>x <font face="Symbol">&sup3;</font> h.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we endeavour to decrease the uncertainty in the
position coordinate (i.e., make <font face="Symbol">D</font> <i>x</i> small)
there will be a corresponding increase in the uncertainty of the momentum
of the electron along the same coordinate, such that the product of the
two uncertainties is always equal to Planck's constant. We saw this effect
in our experiments wherein we employed light of short <font face="Symbol">l</font>
to locate the position of the electron more precisely. When we did this
we excited the electron to one of the other available quantum states, thus
making a knowledge of the energy and hence the momentum uncertain. We might
also try to defeat Heisenberg's uncertainty principle by decreasing the
length of the line <i>L</i>. By shortening <i>L</i>, we would decrease
the uncertainty as to where the electron is. However, as was noted previously,
the momentum increases as <i>L</i> is decreased and the uncertainty in
<i>p</i>
is always the same order of magnitude as <i>p</i> itself; in this case
twice the magnitude of&nbsp; <i>p</i>. Thus the decrease in <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i>
obtained by decreasing <i>L</i> is offset by the increase in <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>p</i>
which accompanies the increased confinement of the electron; the product
<font face="Symbol">D</font><i>x</i><font face="Symbol">D</font><i>
p</i> remains unchanged in value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can illustrate the operation of Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle for a free particle by referring again to our hypothetical experiment
in which we attempted to locate the position of an electron by using a
microscope. We imagine the electron to be free and travelling with a <b><i>known
momentum</i> </b>in the direction of the <i>x</i>-axis with a photon entering
from below along the y-axis. When the photon is scattered by the electron
it <b><i>may</i></b> transfer momentum to the electron and continue on
a line which makes an angle <font face="Symbol">q</font>' to the y-axis
<font color="#FF0000"><a href="section_1-3.html#Fig_2-6.">(Fig.
2-6)</a></font>. The photon, in doing so, will acquire momentum in the
direction of the <i>x</i>-axis, a direction in which it initially had none.
Since momentum must be conserved, the electron will receive a recoil momentum,
a momentum equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that gained
by the photon. This is the Compton effect. Thus our act of observing the
electron will lead to an uncertainty in its momentum as the amount of momentum
transferred during the collision is uncontrollable. We may, however, set
limits on the amount transferred and in this way determine the uncertainty
introduced into the value of the momentum of the electron.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The momentum of the photon before the collision is
all directed along the y-axis and has a magnitude equal to <i>h</i>/<font face="Symbol">l</font>
. After colliding with the electron the photon may be scattered to the
left or to the right of the y-axis through any angle <font face="Symbol">q</font>'
lying between 0 and <font face="Symbol">q</font> and still be collected
by the lens of the microscope and seen by the observer at <i>A</i>. Thus
every photon which passes through the microscope will have an uncertainty
of 2(<i>h</i>/<font face="Symbol">l</font>)sin<font face="Symbol">q</font>
in its component of momentum along the <i>x</i>-axis since it <b><i>may</i></b>
have been scattered by the maximum amount to the left and acquired a component
of -(<i>h</i>/<font face="Symbol">l</font>)sin<font face="Symbol">q</font>
or, on the other hand, it <b><i>may</i></b> have been scattered by the
maximum amount to the right and acquired a momentum component of +(<i>h</i>/<font face="Symbol">l</font>)sin<font face="Symbol">q</font>.
Any <i>x</i>-component of momentum acquired by the photon must have been
lost by the electron and the uncertainty introduced into the momentum of
the electron by the observation is also equal to 2(<i>h</i>/<font face="Symbol">l</font>)sin<font face="Symbol">q</font>
.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the uncertainty induced in the momentum
of the electron by the act of measurement, there is also an inherent uncertainty
in its position (equation <b><font color="#3333FF">(3)</font></b>) because
of the limited resolving power of the microscope. The product of the two
uncertainties at the instant of measurement or immediately following it
is:

Heisenberg's uncertainty relationship is again fulfilled. Our experiment
employs only a single photon which, since light itself is quantized, represents
the smallest packet of energy and momentum which we can use in making the
observation. Even in this idealized experiment the act of observation creates
an unavoidable disturbance in the system.
