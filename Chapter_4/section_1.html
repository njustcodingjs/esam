<br><b><font size=+1>The Atomic Orbital Concept</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the nuclear charge is twice the electronic
charge, the electrostatic energy of repulsion between the electrons will
be the smallest of the three terms in equation <b><font color="#3333FF">(1)</font></b>
when the interactions are averaged over all possible positions of the electrons.
We could obtain an approximation to the electronic energy of the He atom
by neglecting this small term. This is a good idea for another reason.
If we ignore the repulsion between the electrons, then physically we are
supposing that neither electron "realizes" the other electron is present.
The problem is thus identical to that of the hydrogen atom, a problem which
can be solved exactly, except that the nuclear charge is now +2 rather
than +1.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The energy of each electron in the field of a nucleus
of charge +2 is determined separately and the total energy is then simply
the sum of the two energies. This is the first approximation to the energy.
We will also obtain an approximation to the manner in which the electrons
are distributed in space. With this latter knowledge, we can estimate the
energy of repulsion between the electrons. That is, with the knowledge
of how the electrons are distributed relative to one another we can pick
up the term in the potential energy we originally neglected, the term <i>e</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>/<i>r<sub><font size=-2>12</font></sub></i>,
and calculate its contribution to the energy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This method of calculating the electronic energy of atoms
reduces a <b><i>many-electron </i></b>problem to many <b><i>one-electron</i></b>
problems. Each electron (moving in the attractive field of the nucleus)
is treated independently of the others. In addition, since the problem
is now a set of one-electron problems, we may carry over and use all of
the results obtained for the hydrogen atom.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We pointed out in our discussion of the hydrogen atom that
the results we obtained could be applied to any one-electron system by
setting <i>Z</i> equal&nbsp; to the appropriate value in all of the formulae.
The one-electron energies are easily calculated and are given by&nbsp;<img src="Image237.gif" height=46 width=82 align=ABSCENTER>.
More important, the concept of atomic orbitals, the one-electron wave functions
for the hydrogen atom, may be employed in the many-electron case. When
each electron is considered in turn, its motion and distribution in space
will again be determined by an atomic orbital. The atomic orbitals will
differ from the case of&nbsp; the hydrogen atom in that they will generally
be more contracted&nbsp; In the previous chapter we pointed out that the
average value of the distance between the nucleus and the electron,&nbsp;<img src="Image107.gif" height=21 width=12 align=ABSCENTER>,
decreased as the nuclear charge and hence the attractive force exerted
by the nucleus was increased However, the orbitals will still be determined
by the three quantum numbers <i>n</i>,<i> l</i> and <i>m</i>. Increasing
<i>Z</i>
contracts the orbital, but the symmetry of the problem&nbsp; is left unchanged,
i.e., the attraction of the electron by the nucleus is still determined
only by the distance between them and does not depend on the direction.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The<i> l</i> and <i>m</i> dependences of the orbitals,
which determine the directional properties of the orbital and of the electron
density distribution, remain unchanged. Thus we may still refer to "hydrogen-like"
1<i>s</i>, 2s, 2<i>p</i> orbitals For example, the 1<i>s</i> orbital is
the most stable orbital (most negative <i>E</i> value) for any value of
<i>Z</i>,
and we naturally assume that the most stable form of the helium atom will
be obtained when <b><i>both</i></b> electrons are placed in the 1<i>s</i>
orbital. This information, telling us in which atomic orbital the electrons
have been placed, is called an <b><i>electron configuration</i></b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; An abbreviated notation is used to denote the electron
configuration For example, the lowest energy state of helium, in which
two electrons are placed in the 1<i>s</i> orbital, is written as 1<i>s<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup></i>.
(This is to be read as one-<i>s</i>-two and not as one-<i>s</i>-squared.)
When one of the electrons is placed in an orbital of higher energy, an
"excited" configuration is obtained. An example might be 1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup>2<i>p</i><sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup>
which one electron is in the 1<i>s</i> orbital and one electron is in the
2<i>p</i> orbital. It should be emphasized that the concept of assigning
an electronto an atomic orbital is a rigorous and exact concept <b><i>only</i></b>
for the hydrogen atom; for the many-electron case it is an approximation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The atomic orbital approximation may be tested by applying
it to the helium atom. We have seen that the energy of a single electron
moving in the attractive field of a nucleus of charge +<i>Ze</i> is

<p>for the 1<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> electron configuration. To this energy
value must be added the energy of replusion between the two electrons.
Since both electrons have been placed in a 1<i>s</i> atomic orbital, we
know that the charge distribution for each electron must be spherical and
centred on the helium nucleus. The two charge distributions will be completely
intermingled and we must calculate the energy of replusion between every
small element of charge density of the one distribution with every small
charge element of the second distribution. This calculation can be readily
done by the methods of integral calculus and the value of the average energy
replusion is found to be

<p>We label this energy <i>E<sub>c</sub></i> as it is a correction to our
first approximation to the energy. Notice that in general <i>E<sub>c</sub></i>
depends directly on the value of <i>Z.</i> This makes physical sense, for
the greater the value of <i>Z</i>, the more contracted and superimposed
are the two charge distributions, and the greater is the energy of replusion
between them. Note as well that the correction <i>E<sub>c </sub></i>is
indeed smaller than <i>E</i><sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub>, an assumption
we made in developing this method of approximating the electronic energy.

<p>This total energy is called the electronic binding energy as it is the
energy released when two initially free electrons are bound to the helium
nucleus Recall that -<i>K</i> represents the binding energy of the most
stable state of the hydrogen atom; thus the helium atom is five and one
half times more stable than the hydrogen atom. This is not really a fair
comparison because the value (11/2)<i>K</i> is the energy required to remove
both electrons from the helium atom (a double ionization)

<p>as there is but a single electron left. The energy of the ionized electron
<i>E<sub>e</sub></i>-
is set equal to zero as it is assumed to be at rest infinitely far away
from the ion and <i>E</i><sub>He</sub> =&nbsp; -(11/2)<i>K</i>. Thus<i>
I</i>, the first ionization potential of helium, is equal to 1.5K, or one
and one half times larger than the energy required to ionize a hydrogen
atom.
<p>&nbsp; How well do our calculated values for the ionization potential
and total energy agree with the experimental results? The energy required
for the removal of both electrons is 78.98 ev. Since <i>K</i> = 13.61 ev,
the calculated value is (11/2)13.61 = 74.86 ev. This is an encouraging
result as the error is only about 5%. The experimental value for<i> I</i>
is 24.58 ev and our calculated value is (1.5)13.61 = 20.42 ev. The percentage
error is larger for the latter case because the actual error is the same
in both calculations but <i>I </i>is smaller than <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>E.</i>
However, the method seems promising. We have indeed predicted that it requires
almost twice as much energy to remove an electron from helium as it does
to remove one from hydrogen.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The calculations outlined above may be improved by introducing
the concept of an <b><i>effective nuclear charge</i></b>. Since there are
two electrons present in the helium atom, neither electron experiences
the full attractive force of the two positive charges on the helium nucleus.
Each electron partially screens the nuclear charge from the other. We saw
previously that the averagevalue of the distance between an electron and
the nucleus for a strictly hydrogen-like orbital varied as (1/<i>Z</i>).
Thus by assuming that each electron moves in the field of the full nuclear
charge of helium, we consider it to be in a 1<i>s</i> orbital with exactly
one half the value of&nbsp;<img src="Image107.gif" height=21 width=12 align=ABSCENTER>
as that found for a hydrogen 1<i>s</i> orbital. Since the electron on the
average experiences a rereduced nuclear charge (i.e., the effective nuclear
charge) because of the screening effect of the second electron, we should
place it in a 1<i>s</i> orbital which possesses an&nbsp;<img src="Image107.gif" height=21 width=12 align=ABSCENTER>
value somewhere between that found for an orbital for the cases <i>Z</i>
= 1 and <i>Z</i> = 2. In other words, the size of the orbital should be
determined by an effective nuclear charge, rather than by the actual nuclear
charge. This lowered value for <i>Z</i> will obviously decrease the value
of the average repulsion energy between the electrons as the two charge
clouds will be more expanded and the average distance between the charge
points in each distribution will increase. An increased value of<img src="Image107.gif" height=21 width=12 align=ABSCENTER>
will also decrease the average kinetic energy of the electrons and thus
again lead to an increase in the stability of the atom. On the other hand,
an increase in&nbsp;<img src="Image107.gif" height=21 width=12 align=ABSCENTER>
will lead to a less negative potential energy as the electrons will on
the average be further away from the nucleus. Thus there is some best value
for the effective nuclear charge and for&nbsp;<img src="Image107.gif" height=21 width=12 align=ABSCENTER>,
the value which gives the most stable description of the atom. For helium
this "best" value for the effective nuclear charge is found to be 1.687
and the total energy of He is now&nbsp; calculated to be 77.48 ev. The
error has been reduced to approximately 2%.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The effective nuclear charge value cannot be inserted into
equation <b><font color="#3333FF">(2)</font></b> to determine the energy
of the electron. The <i>Z</i> in equation <b><font color="#3333FF">(2)</font></b>
refers to the actual nuclear charge, while the effective nuclear charge
is a number, always less than the actual <i>Z</i>. which determines the
optimum size of the orbital when other electrons are present. The value
of <i>Z</i> appearing in the equate for <i>E<sub>c</sub></i> will be the
effective nuclear charge value. The value of <i>E<sub>c</sub></i> is indeed
determined solely by the degree to which the two electron distributions
are contracted and this is governed by the effective nuclear charge. It
should be pointed out that the concept of an effective nuclear charge will
be paramount&nbsp; in our future discussions concerning the electronic
structures and properties of many-electron atoms.
<p><b>Excited states of the helium atom.</b>&nbsp; Just as the single electron
in the hydrogen atom can be excited to higher quantum levels, so it should
be possible to excite one of the electrons in the He atom to energy levels
with quantum numbers greater than one. This will change the electron configuration
from 1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> to say, l<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup>2<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup>
or 1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup>2<i>p</i><sup><font size=-2>1</font></sup>
etc. The excited electron may again lose the excitation energy in the form
of light and fall back to the 1<i>s</i> level, giving the ground electronic
configuration 1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>

<p>Thus the helium atom should emit a line spectrum when it is excited
in an electrical discharge tube. Since only a single electron is excited
at a given&nbsp; time although if is possible with the use of a laser to
excite two electrons simultanously-the spectrum for helium should be formally
the
same as that observed for hydrogen. However, since the nuclear charge experienced
by the electron will always be greater than one, the lines in the helium
spectrum should be observed at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths)
than those for hydrogen.

<p>Qualitatively the two spectra are the same, as our model predicted.
In addition, the helium lines occur at shorter wavelengths (higher energies)
than for hydrogen. In fact, for every series of lines (Lyman, Balmer, etc.)
found for hydrogen, there is a corresponding series found at shorter wavelengths
for helium. Our model, which uses hydrogen-like atomic orbitals to describe
many-electron atoms, looks promising indeed. However, it is in the study
of the spectrum of helium that we encounter the first shortcoming of this
simple approach; there are two series of lines observed for helium for
every single series of lines observed for hydrogen. Not only does helium
possess the "Balmer" series quoted in Table 4-1, it has a second "Balmer"series
starting at<font face="Symbol"> l </font>= 3889A. That is, the whole series
is repeated at shorter wavelengths. Rather than abandon the atomic orbital
approach for the many-electron atom, let us keep the above failure of the
method in mind and proceed with an application to the lithium atom.
<p><b>The lithium atom.&nbsp;</b> There are three electrons in the lithium
atom (<i>Z =</i> 3) but the total repulsion energy between the electrons
is still determined by considering the repulsions between a pair of electrons
at a time. For this reason, three electrons are fundamentally no more difficult
to treat than two electrons. There are simply more possible pairs and hence
more repulsive interactions to consider than in the two-electron case.
The dependence of the potential energy on the distances between the electrons
and between the electrons and the nucleus is

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is natural to assume that, as in the case of hydrogen
or helium, the most stable energy of the lithium atom will be obtained
when all three electrons are placed in the 1<i>s</i> atomic orbital giving
the electronic configuration 1<i>s</i><sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>.

<p>This represents the sum of the energies obtained when each electron
is considered to move independently in the field of the nucleus of charge
+3 in an orbital with<i> n </i>= 1. To this must be added the energy of
repulsion between the electrons. The average repulsion energy between a

In lithium we must consider the repulsion between electrons 1 and 2, between
electrons 1 and 3, and between electrons 2 and 3. Therefore the total repulsion
energy which represents the correction to <i>E</i> is

<p>Thus it should require 214.4 ev to remove all three electrons from the
lithium atom.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can also calculate the energy required to remove
a single electron from&nbsp; lithium (the first ionization potential)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the predicted values for lithium
are compared with the corresponding experimental values, they are found
to be in serious error. The lithium atom is not as stable as the calculations
would suggest. Experimentally it requires 202.5 ev to remove all three
electrons from lithium, and only 5.4 ev to remove one electron. Experimentally
it requires less energy to ionize lithium than it does to ionize hydrogen,
yet our calculation predicts an ionization energy one and one half times
larger. The error in <i>I</i> is 300%! We should expect a realistic model
to do better than this. More serious than this, however, is that the kind
of calculation we are doing should never predict the system to be more
stable than it actually is. The method should always predict an energy
less negative than is actually observed. If this is not&nbsp; found to
be the case, then it means that an incorrect assumption has been made or
that some physical principle has been ignored. It is also clear that if
we were to continue this scheme of placing each succeeding electron in
the 1<i>s </i>orbital as we increased the nuclear charge by unity we would
never predict the most striking property of the elements:&nbsp; the property
of periodicity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might recall at this point that there is a periodicity
in the types of atomic orbitals found for the hydrogen atom. With every
increase in <i>n</i>, all the preceding values of<i> l </i>are repeated,
and a new<i> l </i>value is introduced. If we could discover a physical
reason for not placing all of the electrons in the1<i>s</i> orbital, but
instead place succeeding electrons in the orbitals with higher<i> n</i>
values, we could expect to obtain a periodicity in our predicted electronic
structures for the atoms. This periodicity in electronic structure would
then explain the observed periodicity in their properties. There must be
another factor governing the behaviour of electrons and this factor must
be one which determines the number of electrons that may be accommodated
in a given orbital. To discover what this missing factor is and to find
the physical basis for it, we must investigate further the magnetic properties
of electrons.
