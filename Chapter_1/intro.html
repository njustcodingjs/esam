<hr width="100%"><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;The Nature of the Problem</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The understanding and prediction of the properties
of matter at the atomic level represents one of the great achievements
of twentieth-century science. The theory developed to describe the behaviour
of electrons, atoms and molecules differs radically from familiar Newtonian
physics, the physics governing the motions of macroscopic bodies and the
physical events of our everyday experiences. The discovery and formulation
of the fundamental concepts of atomic physics in the period 1901 to 1926
by such men as Planck, Einstein, de Broglie and Heisenberg caused what
can only be described as a revolution in the then-accepted basic concepts
of physics.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new theory is called <b><i>quantum theory</i></b>
or <b><i>quantum mechanics</i></b>. As far as we now know this theory is
able to account for all observable behaviour of matter and, with suitable
extensions, for the interaction of matter with light. The proper formulation
of quantum mechanics and its application to a specific problem requires
a rather elaborate mathematical framework, as do proper statements and
applications of Newtonian physics. We may, however, in this introductory
account acquaint ourselves with the critical experiments which led to the
formulation of quantum mechanics and apply the basic concepts of this new
mechanics to the study of electrons.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically the problem we set ourselves is to discover
the physical laws governing the behaviour of electrons and then apply these
laws to determine how the electrons are arranged when bound to nuclei to
form atoms and molecules. This arrangement of electrons is termed the <b><i>electronic
structure</i></b> of the atom or molecule. Furthermore, we shall discuss
the relationship between the electronic structure of an atom and its physical
properties, and how the electronic structure is changed during a chemical
reaction.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rutherford's nuclear model for the atom set the stage
for the understanding of the structure of atoms and the forces holding
them together<font color="#000000">. <font size=-1><a href="intronote.html" onclick="return popup(this, 'chpt1intro')">(Click
here for note.)</a></font></font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Rutherford's alpha-scattering experiments it
was clear that the atom consisted of a positively-charged nucleus with
negatively-charged electrons arranged in some fashion around it, the electrons
occupying a volume of space many times larger than that occupied by the
nucleus. (The diameters of nuclei fall in the range of l <font face="Symbol">&acute;</font>
10<sup><font size=-2>-12</font></sup> <font face="Symbol">&reg;</font>
1 <font face="Symbol">&acute;</font> 10<sup><font size=-2>-13</font></sup>
cm, while the diameter of an atom is typically of the order of magnitude
of 1 <font face="Symbol">&acute;</font> 10<sup><font size=-2>-8</font></sup>
cm.) The forces responsible for binding the atom, and in fact all matter
(aside from the nuclei themselves), are electrostatic in origin: the positively-charged
nucleus attracts the negatively-charged electrons. There are attendant
magnetic forces which arise from the motions of the charged particles.
These magnetic forces give rise to many important physical phenomena, but
they are smaller in magnitude than are the electrostatic forces and they
are not responsible for the binding found in matter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a chemical reaction only the number and arrangement
of the electrons are changed, the nucleus remaining unaltered. The unchanging
charge of the atomic nucleus is responsible for retaining the atom's chemical
identity through any chemical reaction. Thus for the purpose of understanding
the chemical properties and behaviour of atoms, the nucleus may be regarded
as simply a point charge of constant magnitude for a given element, giving
rise to a central field of force which binds the electrons to the atom.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rutherford proposed his nuclear model of the atom
in 1911, some fifteen years before the formulation of quantum mechanics.
Consequently his model, when first proposed, posed a dilemma for classical
physics. The nuclear model, based as it was on experimental observations,
had to be essentially correct, yet all attempts to account for the stability
of such a system using Newtonian mechanics ended in failure.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Newtonian mechanics we should be able
to obtain a complete solution to the problem of the electronic structure
of atoms once the nature of the force between the nucleus and the electron
is known. The electrostatic force operative in the atom is well understood
and is described by Coulomb's law, which states that the force between
two particles with charges <i>e<sub><font size=-2>1</font></sub></i> and
<i>e<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub></i>
separated by a distance <i>R</i> is given by:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a theorem of electrostatics which states that
no stationary arrangement of charged particles can ever be in electrostatic
equilibrium, i.e., be stable to any further change in their position. This
means that all the particles in a collection of postively and negatively
charged species will always have resultant forces of attraction or repulsion
acting on them no matter how they are arranged in space. Thus no model
of the atom which invokes some stationary arrangement of the electrons
around the nucleus is possible. The electrons must be in motion if electrostatic
stability is to be preserved. However, an electron moving in the field
of a nucleus experiences a force and, according to Newton's second law
of motion, would be accelerated. The laws of electrodynamics state that
an accelerated charged particle should emit light and thus continuously
lose energy. In this dynamical model of the atom, all of the electrons
would spiral into the nucleus with the emission of light and all matter
would collapse to a much smaller volume, the volume occupied by the nuclei.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one was able to devise a theoretical model based
on Newtonian, or what is now called classical mechanics, which would explain
the electrostatic stability of atoms. The inescapable conclusion was that
the classical equations of motion did not apply to the electron. Indeed,
by the early 1900's a number of physical phenomena dealing with light and
with events on the atomic level were found to be inexplicable in terms
of classical mechanics. It became increasingly clear that Newtonian mechanics,
while predicting with precision the motions of masses ranging in size from
stars to microscopic particles, could not predict the behaviour of particles
of the extremely small masses encountered in the atomic domain. The need
for a new set of laws was indicated.
