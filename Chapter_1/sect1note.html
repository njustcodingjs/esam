This
is not true when the photoelectric effect is considered from the macroscopic
point of view, that is, when the total current produced by the beam of
light is measured.&nbsp; In this case an increase in the intensity of the
light results in an increase in the number of ejected electrons and in
an increased current. It is only when we consider the energy&nbsp; imparted
to an individual electron on the atomic level that the relationship between&nbsp;
energy and frequency becomes apparent and the concept of quantization becomes
necessary.
