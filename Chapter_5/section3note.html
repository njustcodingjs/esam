The
experimental value of the electron affinity is found to be larger for chlorine
than for fluorine. This is surprising since the vacancy in chlorine is
in a 3<i>p</i> subshell compared with the 2<i>p</i> vacancy in fluorine,
and is thus further removed from the attractive force of the nucleus. A
possible explanation for this reversal of the expected order might be the
greater increase in the average electron-electron repulsion energy for
F <font face="Symbol">&reg;</font>&nbsp; F<sup>-</sup> than for Cl <font face="Symbol">&reg;</font>&nbsp;
Cl<sup>- </sup>since the fluorine atom is smaller than the chlorine atom.
The overall energy of the process is determined by the energy decrease
due to the binding of the extra electron (as determined by the effective
nuclear charge and favouring fluorine over chlorine) and the energy increase
due to the repulsion of the added electron by those already present. The
repulsion effect should be smaller for the Cl atom since its charge density
is more diffuse. The net decrease in energy can therefore be greater for
Cl than for F even though F possesses the larger effective nuclear charge.
