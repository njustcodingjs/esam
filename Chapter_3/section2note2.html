Please
do not confuse the word orbital with the classical word and notion of an
orbit. First, an orbit implies the knowledge of a definite trajectory or
path for a particle through space which in itself is not possible for an
electron. Secondly, an orbital, like the wave function, has no physical
reality but is a mathematical function which when squared gives the physically
measurable electron density distribution.
