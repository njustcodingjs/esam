It
is common usage to refer to an electron as being "in" an orbital even though
an orbital is but a mathematical function with no physcial reality. To
say an electron is in a particular orbital is meant to imply that the electron
is in the quantum state which is described by that orbital. For example,
when the electron is in the 2<i>s</i> orbital the hydrogen atom is in a
state for which <i>n</i> = 2 and <i>l</i> = 0.
