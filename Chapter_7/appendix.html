<br><b><font size=+1>A QUANTITATIVE DEFINITION OF ATOMIC CHARGE</font></b>
<p>Since the publication of this book in 1970, a theory of atoms in molecules
(AIM) has been developed that enables one to define an atom in a molecule
and all of its properties. The theoretical definition of an atom is based
on the properties of the experimentally observable charge density. This
theory is described elsewhere in this web site, but we present here a brief
introduction to enable a quantitative definition of the charge on atom
in a molecule. The theory is fully described and developed in the book
"Atoms in molecules: a quantum theory", published by the University of
Oxford Press, 1990.
<p>A molecule, or a crystal, is partitioned into individual atoms in terms
of surfaces that satisfy a particular condition on the electron density.
The partitioning is a direct result of the density exhibiting a maximum
at the position of each nucleus. As a consequence, the density passes through
some minimum value before again attaining some maximum value at a neighbouring
nucleus, as illustrated in the displays of the molecular density distributions
shown in this book. This fundamental property of a charge distribution
is illustrated in the accompanying figure, <a href="appendix.html#Fig_A1">Fig. A1</a>
which displays the electron density in a plane of the nuclei for the LiF
molecule. The distribution is dominated by the two nuclear maxima. The
point of minimum density along the line linking the two nuclei – the saddle
point in the density – is a starting point for two paths of steepest descent
away from this point, paths that define the boundary separating the atoms
in this plane. The collection of such paths for all planes obtained by
rotation about the axis defines the interatomic surface. The interatomic
surfaces defined in this manner yield a ‘natural partitioning’ of a molecule
into atoms, as illustrated in Fig. A1 for LiF and in <a href="appendix.html#Fig_A2">Figures
A2a</a> and <a href="appendix.html#Fig_A2">A2b</a> for the second- and third-row diatomic
hydrides.
<p>The properties of the atoms defined by these ‘natural’ surfaces are
determined by quantum mechanics. Thus, not only does quantum mechanics
predict the properties of a molecule, it also predicts the properties of
its individual constituent atoms. The theory of atoms in molecules (AIM)
equates every property of a molecule to the sum of its atomic contributions.
Among the properties of immediate interest is the charge on an atom. The
electron population of an atom A - its average number of electrons - a
quantity denoted by N(A), is obtained by integrating the electron density
over the space of the atom up to its atomic boundaries, as given in equation
<b><font color="#3366FF">A-1</font></b>
where the electron density at a point denoted by the position vector <b>r</b>
is denoted by <font face="Symbol">r</font> (<b>r</b>)

The subscript A on the integral means that the integration is carried out
over the space of the atom A up to its atomic boundary, that is, its interatomic
surface. The charge on the atom, q(A), is the difference between the nuclear
charge Z<sub>A</sub> and its electron population, as given in equation
<b><font color="#3366FF">A-2</font></b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another useful property determined by the electron density
is the atomic polarization. In a free atom the centroid of negative charge
coincides with the nucleus and there is no dipole moment, that is, no separation
of charge. When an atom is in chemical combination, its density becomes
polarized, either towards or away from a neighbouring atom, as discussed
and illustrated in this chapter. One can easily determine the displacement
of the centroid of negative charge from the position of the nucleus by
determining the average (vector) distance of every element of the electron
density from the nucleus of the atom. This corresponds to integrating the
product of the density at each position <b>r</b>, with the vector distance
of this point from the nucleus, a distance denoted by the vector <b>r</b><sub>A</sub>
to obtain the atomic moment <b>M</b>(A). Its definition is given in equation
<b><font color="#3366FF">A-3</font></b>.

The atomic moment is a vector because it has a direction as well as a magnitude.
<p>The dipole moment <b><font face="Symbol">m</font></b> of a diatomic
molecule A-B, when expressed in terms of atomic contributions, is given
by a charge transfer term, equal to the charge on atom B multiplied by
<b>R</b>,
the vector distance from the nucleus of A and to that of B, and a polarization
term given by the sum of the two atomic moments. The dipole moment of A-B
is therefore given as in equation <b><font color="#3366FF">A-4</font></b>

where all three terms are directed along the internuclear axis. The sign
of the charge transfer term q(B)<b>R</b> is determined by the sign of q(B)
= -q(A). The model expression for <font face="Symbol">m</font> given for
LiF in the text assumes the complete transfer of one electron from Li to
F and equates the dipole moment to the charge transfer term alone, that
is, to the first term of equation <b><font color="#3366FF">A-4</font></b>.
We can use the molecular density distribution for LiF displayed in <font color="#000000"><a href="file:////Aim/intro to aam/Chapter 7/ref-fig7-9.html">Fig.
7-9</a></font> or <a href="appendix.html#Fig_A1">Fig. A1</a> to calculate the charges
on the atoms and determine the atomic polarizations to illustrate how the
atomic contributions determine the molecular dipole. The charge on F is
q(F) = -0.938<i>e</i>, close to the value of -1<i>e</i> assumed in the
model calculation. As already discussed, the atoms are in general polarized
in a direction counter to the direction of the charge transfer. In LiF
the charge transfer is from Li <font face="Symbol">&reg;</font> F and hence
the fluorine atom is polarized towards the lithium atom which in turn is
polarized away from the fluorine atom. The length of the vector
<b>R</b>
in LiF is 1.564 &Aring; and expressing the charge on the fluorine atom
in esu, the charge transfer contribution to the dipole moment is – 7.05
debyes. The atomic polarizations are <b>M</b>(F) = +0.714 and <b>M</b>(Li)
= +0.043 debyes to yield a dipole moment with a magnitude of 6.29 debyes,
the experimental value being 6.28 debyes.

<p>Pauling (1960) defined electronegativity to be 'the power of an atom
in a molecule to attract electrons to itself.' This concept has proved
to be extremely useful and it is reflected in the net charges on the atoms
found in diatomic molecules, as determined by the theory of atoms in molecules.
The atomic charges in a diatomic molecule are a direct measure of the relative
abilities of the two atoms to attract and bind electronic charge within
their basins. The variation in the charge on atom A in AB where A and B
vary across the second row of the periodic table, Li <font face="Symbol">&reg;</font>

position of the reference atom are negative, all those to its right are

<p>Each atom withdraws charge from elements to the left of it and donates
charge to those on its right, with H appearing between C and N. The orderings
are as anticipated with C and H possessing almost equal electronegativities.
The electronegativity of C relative to H increases with the degree of unsaturation
and with the extent of geometric strain. This result is anticipated on
the basis of the orbital model which predicts the electronegativity of
C to increase as the s character of its hybrid bonds to H increases. Most
of the secondary variation in charges across the table are explicable in
terms of the extent of charge transfer being limited by either the number
of valence electrons on the donor or vacancies on the acceptor. The charges
on the third-row elements Na <font face="Symbol">&reg; </font>Cl are also
given relative to H in their hydrides and, as anticipated, H advances towards
the electronegative end of the scale in this row relative to its position

less electropositive than their second-row congeners.

<p>The extent and direction of charge transfer and its effect on the charge
distribution are reflected in the behaviour of the interatomic surface
which is indicated for each molecule. In LiH the surface envelops what
is essentially a Li ion while in HF the total charge distribution is dominated
by the forces exerted by the F nucleus. The charges <i>q</i>(H) of AH are
also characteristic of the stable polyatomic species AH<i><sub>n</sub></i>
the two values usually differing by less than 0.05 <i>e</i>, and they reflect
the chemical behaviour of the hydrides. The hydrides of Li, Be, and B,
for example, are all hydridic, expelling molecular hydrogen from water
and, for all of these, <i>q</i>(H) &lt; 0. There is a sharp break in the
value of <i>q</i>(H) for methane for which <i>q</i>(H) <font face="Symbol">&raquo;</font>
0 and this is a faithful reflection of the non-polar nature of this molecule.
It has a low solubility in water and does not dissociate. The remaining
hydrides, NH<sub><font size=-2>3</font></sub>, H<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>O,
and HF, are all increasingly polar with <i>q</i>(H) > 0 and the ordering
of the charges accounts for the aqueous solution of ammonia being basic
and that of HF being acidic.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability to determine the charge on an atom in a molecule
removes the necessity of defining a numerical electronegativity scale.
The concept, however, remains useful and one may use the atomic populations
to demonstrate that they recover the basic idea underlying electronegativity—to
predict the degree of charge transfer between two atoms. Since hydrogen
can either donate or accept but a single electron, the electron population
of hydrogen in AH may be used to define an electronegativity per electron
of A relative to hydrogen.&nbsp; This&nbsp; electronegativity&nbsp; is&nbsp;
given&nbsp; by&nbsp; <i>X</i>(A) = 1 - <i>N</i>(H)<sub>AH</sub>, where
<i>N</i>(H)<sub>AH</sub>
is the population of H in AH. A positive or negative value for <i>X</i>(A)
implies that A has a greater or lesser bonding electron affinity than does
hydrogen, respectively. If the <i>X</i>(A) are meaningful, then the difference&nbsp;
|<i>X</i>(A) - <i>X</i>(B)| should determine the charge transfer per valence
electron in AB. Using this concept, the population of A in AB is predicted
to be
<br>&nbsp;
<table width="100%">

</table>
where v is the number of valence electrons on the donor A or the number
of vacancies on the acceptor B, whichever value is limiting. <i>N</i>(A)<sub>a</sub>
is the electron population of the isolated A atom. Examples of predicted
and actual atomic populations for A are: NF, 6.56 (6.56); NO, 6.46 (6.50);
CF, 5.21 (5.22); CO, 4.78 (4.65); CN, 4.94 (4.88); LiC, 2.12 (2.12). With
the added stipulation that the charge transferred per vacancy, |<i>X</i>(A)
- <i>X</i>(B)|, cannot exceed v, then all diatomic fluoride populations
are predicted to within a maximum error of 0.08 electrons. This method
of predicting the charge transfer between atoms yields significantly larger
errors only for some compounds of the elements Be and B.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The charge distributions of the diatomic hydrides illustrate
a general phenomenon—that a significant degree of interatomic charge transfer
is accompanied by a polarization of the valence densities of the atoms
in a direction counter to that of the charge transfer. The polarizations
are in response to the electric field created by the charge transfer, the
acceptor atom polarizing towards the positively charged donor atom which
is itself polarized away from the negatively charged acceptor. This polarization
of the donor atom is particularly pronounced when it possesses a greater
number of valence electrons than there are vacancies on the acceptor atom,
as illustrated by the data for the diatomic hydrides given in <font color="#000000"><a href="tables.html#Table_A2">Table
A2</a></font>. This Table lists the atomic quantities that determine the
molecular dipole moment, as given in equation <b><font color="#3333FF">A-4</font></b>;
the charges on the atoms (equation <b><font color="#3333FF">A-2</font></b>
for q(A)), the atomic polarizations (equation <b><font color="#3333FF">A-3</font></b>
for <b>M</b>(A)), the charge transfer contribution to the molecular dipole
moment under the heading
<b><font face="Symbol">m</font></b>(CT) = q(H)R
= - q(A)R, the dipole moment for each molecule <b><font face="Symbol">m</font></b>(AH)
and the nonbonded radius of the A atom, r<sub>n</sub>(A).
<p>In general, the magnitude of the molecular dipole is less than that
<b><font face="Symbol">m</font></b>(CT),
the charge transfer contribution, because of the opposing atomic polarizations.
The polarizations of Li and Na in their hydrides are quite small as they
correspond to tightly bound core densities. However, in some instances
such as BH, the atomic polarizations determine the direction of the molecular
moment. For the second row, the atomic polarizations are largest for the
diffuse valence density on Be and B. They are larger still for their third-row
congeners and Si where, because of the larger, 10-electron K-L core, the
valence density is less tightly bound and more polarizable.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempts to assign atomic charges on the basis of
measured dipole moments are unrealistic as such a procedure ignores the
polarizations of the atomic densities. Such an attempt corresponds to assuming
the molecular charge distribution to be composed of a set of spherically
symmetric atomic densities, each centred on its own nucleus, a physically
unacceptable model even in the limit of an ionic system. It should be evident
from a comparison of the charge distribution in the non-bonded region of
the A atoms that the reduction in magnitude or reversal in sign of the
dipole moment, which occurs after LiH in the second-row and after Na in
the third-row, is a consequence of an atomic polarization and is not indicative
of a sudden&nbsp; increase in the electronegativity of the A atom. The
extent of the physical distortion of those atoms for which the atomic polarizations
are greatest is reflected in the values of their non-bonded radii. A <i>non-bonded
radiu</i>s, r<sub>n</sub>(<b><font face="Symbol">W</font></b>), is defined
as the axial distance from a nucleus to an outer contour of the charge
density on its non-bonded side. The 0.001au contour is chosen since the
corresponding density envelopes provide good approximations to the experimentally
determined van der Waals sizes and corresponding radii for molecules in
the gas phase. The non-bonded radii for Li and Na are close to the values
for the corresponding singly-charged ions while those for the strongly
back-polarized atoms are all considerably greater than are their values
in the free atomic state.
<p>&nbsp; The presence of such a large and diffuse (weakly bound) charge
distribution has important chemical consequences, imparting to the molecule
the characteristics of a strong Lewis base. A classic example of this behaviour
is the carbon atom in the CO molecule. This molecule has a near-zero dipole
moment because of very pronounced polarizations of the atomic densities,
particularly that of carbon, which oppose the considerable charge transfer
moment. The charge on oxygen is - 1.33 e and the magnitudes of the opposing
atomic dipoles are |<b>M</b>(O)| = 0.98 au and |<b>M</b>(C)| = 1.72 au
with the non-bonded radius on carbon exceeding its free atomic value by
0.15 au. The physical importance of the atomic polarization of carbon is
reflected in the ability of CO to act as a Lewis base, particularly in
the formation of metal carbonyls. The considerable difference in the electronegativities
of C and O is reflected in the relatively large dipole moment, |<b><font face="Symbol">m</font></b>|&nbsp;
= 1.11 au, of the formaldehyde molecule, H<sub><font size=-2>2</font></sub>C=O.
The charge transfer from C to O in formaldehyde where <i>q</i>(O) = - 1.24
<i>e</i>,
is only slightly less than it is in CO. Unlike CO, however, the charge
transfer contribution dominates the final moment in formaldehyde because
of the close to halving of the atomic dipole on carbon which results from
the use of its non-bonded density in the formation of non-polar bonds to
the hydrogen atoms.
